An implementation of CKTAGA (Centered Kernel Target Alignment with Genetic Algorithms) applied to the Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) domain is contained here. The code requires Yap prolog and Aleph to run. The parser for java interfacing to Aleph is based on Igor Maznitsa's prolog parser which can be found here: https://github.com/raydac/java-prolog-parser. 

The algorithms implemented herein are described here: https://digitalcommons.uri.edu/oa_diss/1090/

Future notes regarding usage will be forthcoming.
